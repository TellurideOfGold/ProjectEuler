# ProjectEuler

Solutions to ProjectEuler.net puzzles, but slightly generalized. For those who may be unfamiliar, the puzzles are typically set up with some variable or bound that is low for an initial example and then raised for the actual puzzle. In these solutions the program takes that bound as its input, and will typically work even for much larger bounds than those given in the puzzle.
